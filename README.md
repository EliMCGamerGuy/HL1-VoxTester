# HL1 VoxTester
A little program I made in a day that checks if the Half Life 1 Vox, HEV Suit, or Marines can say specific things that you type.
it's a pretty simple program, and in NO WAY connects to your actual HL1 installation (if it even exists)

The input needs to be in all lowercase for all voices, with only spaces in between the words. the only exeption being the HECU's yelling! voice! clips!
usually, most things that the HECUs say have a yelling version, to use these voice clips ingame you'd add a exclamation mark after every word.
